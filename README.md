# ASR9K-Simple-Bogon-Prefix-Set
ASR9K Simple Bogon Prefix Set For Filtering Transit AS Routes

The intent of this project is to have a simple bogon set to filter routes from transit AS, both IPv4 and IPv6. This is something the IANA should do a better job of. If there are any mistakes please put in a change and I will verify and update. Below are sources, besides WHOIS, used for this project.
