Routes in the IANA space as seen on IRR Explorer.

# IANA 2001::/23
2001:4:112::/48     Multiple route-object exist with different origins
2001:54:3a::/48     Look like network is not announcing registered v6 prefix yet
2001:5:1::/48       Look like network is not announcing registered v6 prefix yet
2001:5:8::/48       Look like network is not announcing registered v6 prefix yet
2001::/32           Prefix in DFZ, but no route-object with correct origin anywhere
2001:c0:3::/48      Prefix in DFZ, but no route-object with correct origin anywhere
2001:dc::/35        Look like network is not announcing registered v6 prefix yet

Prefixes 2001::/32 and 2001:c0:3::/48 should be in DFZ???
